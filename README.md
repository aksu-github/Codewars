# Codewars Practice Logs in Javascript.

### This is a log of my daily Codewars practice.

### Sorted by day and by difficulty.

I was originally pushing hard on doing more challenging kyus (i.e. 5kyu and above), but then I realized it is not really beneficial if I just muscle my way through them. I decided to use use Codewars more as a way to maintain and build up a stable coding baseline instead, for I am not always able to discern from a good and proper or bad way of coding. For example, the more challenging kyus focused more on optimization which felt like a case by case basis, and not a general rule of thumb to follow.

Edit 07/17/22 - Figured out how to contribute to my own repo. No longer upload each file individually.  
Edit 07/18/22 - Contribution for Codewars repo not registering. No green square update on profile.  
Edit 07/19/22 - Fixed contibution issue. Command line Github email did not match verified email under Github settings.
Edit 07/25/22 - Fixed README.md basic format issue in VS Code. (# for header importance. /s{2} after each line to line break)
