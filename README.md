Codewars Practice Logs in Javascript.

This is a log of my daily Codewars practice.

Is is sorted by day and by difficulty.

I am currently uploading each file individually right now based off my local storage. I am uncertain if I can push this specific local storage to github automatically instead. It seems possible though given how github can be pulled off a main thread.
