# Codewars
Codewars Practice Logs in Javascript.

This is a log of my daily Codewars practice.

Is is sorted by day and by difficulty.

I am currently uploading each file individually right now based off my local storage. I am uncertain if I can push this specific local storage to github automatically instead. It seems possible though given how github can be pulled off a main thread.

I was originally pushing hard on doing harder and harder kata's, but then I realized it is not really beneficial if I just muscle my way through them. I came to realize to use Codewars more as a way to maintain and build up a stable coding baseline instead, for I am not always able to discern from a good and proper or bad way of coding. This became prevalent as I moved into the harder katas that focused more on optimization.

Edit 07/17/2022 // I figured out how to contribute to my own repo. I no longer have to upload each file individually.
Edit 07/18/2022 // My VS Code contribution for Codewars repo did not update a green box in my profile?
Edit 07/19/2022 // Fixed non-contibution on Github. Command line Github email was not the same as the verified email under Github settings.
